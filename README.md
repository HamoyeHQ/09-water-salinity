# California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheres Investigations

## Aim of the project

To build a predictive model to determine the salinity of sea water and factors affecting changes in salinity

## Data Description
**Content**

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) data set represents the longest (1949-2016) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world. The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular time and space intervals quickly became valuable for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a range of biological responses to them. CalCOFI research drew world attention to the biological response to the dramatic Pacific-warming event in 1957-58 and introduced the term “El Niño” into the scientific literature.

The dataset consists of two csv files, bottle.csv and cast.csv. More details about the data can be found [here](https://github.com/HamoyeHQ/09-water-salinity/tree/master/data)

## Our Approach

  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Data Visualization
  * Data Preprocessing
  * Modelling
  * Deployment
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis
This was carried out to  better understand the data. Some of the details we checked for were 
  * Shape of the data
  * General information on the data
  * Statistical summary of the data
  
### Data Visualization

Here we visualized the data to find relationships betweeen features and gained more insight into the data. Examples of some of our visualization are:
